    "description": "[Zero Install](https://0install.net/) is a decentralized cross-platform software-installation system available under the LGPL. It allows software developers to publish programs directly from their own web-sites, while supporting features familiar from centralized distribution repositories such as shared libraries, automatic updates and digital signatures. It is intended to complement, rather than replace, the operating system’s package management. 0install packages never interfere with those provided by the distribution.\n\nZero Install does not define a new packaging format; unmodified tarballs or zip archives can be used. Instead, it defines an XML metadata format to describe these packages and the dependencies between them. A single metadata file can be used on multiple platforms (e.g. Windows, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD and Mac OS X).\n\nZero Install also has some [interesting features](https://docs.0install.net/features/) not often found in traditional package managers. For example, while it will share libraries whenever possible, it can always install multiple versions of a package in parallel when there are conflicting requirements. Installation is always side-effect-free (each package is unpacked to its own directory and will not touch shared directories), making it ideal for use with sandboxing technologies and virtualization.",

    "description": "### Overview\nAcrylic is a local DNS proxy for Windows which improves the performance of your computer by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers and helps you fight unwanted ads through a custom HOSTS file optimized for handling hundreds of thousands of domain names and with additional support for wildcards and regular expressions.\n\nWhen you browse a web page a portion of its loading time is dedicated to name resolution (usually from a few milliseconds to 1 second or more) while the rest is dedicated to the transfer of the web page contents and resources to your browser. What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses closest to zero possible. It may not seem such a great optimization but in a few weeks of Internet browsing you will probably save an hour or so, which is definitely not such a bad thing. Furthermore Acrylic's sliding expiration caching mechanism, simultaneous forwarding to multiple DNS servers and support for background DNS updates are able to improve your browsing experience independently of the browser.\n\nWith Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in that case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite websites and to your email server.\n\nAnother good thing is that Acrylic is released as open source, which means that it's free and its source code, written with Borland Delphi, is freely available to anyone under the GNU General Public License.\n\nThis Chocolatey package will install Acrylic DNS Proxy into `Program Files (x86)` and register a Windows service called `Acrylic DNS Proxy`.",

This leaves your email inbox at risk of spam, marketing junk and unimportant messages that waste your time. Even worse, there’s a danger of receiving malware, viruses or becoming the victim of online abuse. Dedicated email address tagging software is perfect for when you:\n\n* Need to sign up to a website but you’re worried that your email address might get shared with third-party advertisers.\n* Are required to provide an email address to a mobile app that shouldn’t be sending you messages.\n* Make a one-off purchase on an e-commerce site and you don’t want to receive follow-up spam emails about their latest offers.\n* Publish your email address in a location like a forum where it could be picked up by address-harvesting spam bots or phishing software.\n* Give out your address to companies that are known for having poor levels of online security.\n* Effectively eliminate the threat of unsolicited emails from third parties and drastically reduce the quantity of junk emails your organization receives.\n\n###How does it work?\n1. A user purchases an item online from www.thinkboxart.com.\n2. At the checkout, they are asked to provide their email address, which is john.doe@mycompany.com.\n3. A unique tag is chosen to help easily identify the site that the user is giving their email address to e.g. “thinkboxart”.\n4. A tag can be made up of any combination of alphanumeric characters.\n5. The email address will now be either: john.doe+thinkboxart@mycompany.com or john.doe--thinkboxart@mycompany.com.\n\n###Stop spam dead in its tracks\n\n* Get total protection against all spam emails when you use Exclaimer Address Tagging for Exchange with Exclaimer Anti-spam.\n* Users will be able to stop any unsolicited email, while the Recurrent Pattern Detection® engine from CYREN® compares every email your organization receives via Exchange against the current global spam traffic trends.\n\nPACKAGING REMINDER: Will only install on Exchange Servers with Hub Transport, Edge Transport, or Mailbox Role installed.",

    "description": "The Adobe Digital Negative Converter enables you to easily convert camera-specific raw files from supported cameras to a more universal, DNG (\"digital negative\") file which is a lossless raw image format designed by Adobe for digital photography.\n\nAdobe DNG Converter gives you the possibility to process an entire directory including subfolders and skip images if the destination file already exists. You can select the location where the converted files are saved, preserve the subfolders structure, create a naming scheme for the converted images, and configure the preferences settings in terms of compatibility mode, compression, and original raw file embedding options.\n\n## Compatibility\nAdobe Digital Negative Converter will only install on Windows 10 (64-bit) version 1809 or later; LTSC versions are not supported.\n\n## Raw files and DNG \nA raw file contains the \"raw\" data captured by the digital camera sensor before it has been converted to JPEG or TIFF formats.  When working with raw files, the file is not compressed or processed in the camera. Instead, software gives the user complete control over the conversion settings. For example, white balance is not applied to the raw file but is stored with the file so the software can default to the originally-intended setting. Other information contained in a DNG file includes standard EXIF metadata (just like in JPEG files), date, time, camera used, and camera settings.\n\n#### Raw files offer the following benefits:\n* Smaller files than uncompressed TIFF\n* Does not have the artifacts of compressed JPEGs\n* Many key camera parameters, such as white balance, can be modified even after the image is captured\n* You have complete control over conversion settings rather than letting the camera decide\n* Access to 16-bit data for greater detail and fidelity\n* Flexibility of converting a single file using multiple conversion settings\n\n## The Digital Negative (DNG) format\nDigital Negative (DNG) is an openly published raw file specification. This format is freely available for other software and hardware vendors to support. Consequently, it can be a safer file format to use for long-term archival purposes because it eliminates worries that the raw file will no longer be readable once the camera-specific format that created it becomes obsolete.\n\nThe Digital Negative specification allows for not only all of the pixel information stored in current raw formats, but also for all of the additional, proprietary metadata that many manufacturers include. The original raw file can also be embedded in the DNG format to ensure that proprietary metadata from the manufacturer is not lost.",

    "description": "Source Sans was designed by Paul D. Hunt under the guidance of Robert Slimbach. It was Adobe's first open source typeface family, conceived primarily as a typeface for user interfaces. Source Sans draws inspiration from the clarity and legibility of twentieth-century American gothic typeface designs. Distilling the best archetypical qualities of these models, Paul followed a rational design approach by simplifying glyph shapes by paring them to their essential form. However, in order to more easily differentiate similar letter shapes (such as uppercase I and lowercase L), some additional details have been added. Besides providing such explicitly clarity in short text strings, another fundamental design consideration was to create a typeface that reads well in extended settings. This can be seen in the general proportions: Source Sans has been designed with a more generous width than many other comparable gothics, and its shorter majuscule letters, combined with minuscule letters with longer extenders, create a more pleasant reading texture in longer text passages.\n\nThis package installs the `.ttf` files in the variable variant.",

    "description": "Source Serif is an open-source typeface for setting text in many sizes, weights, and languages – conceived as a companion to Source Sans. The close companionship of Source Sans and Source Serif is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. While designed to harmonize with its serif-less counterpart, Source Serif often takes its own direction, in part because the two are inspired by different historical precedents. Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like a bottom serif on the `b` or a serif on the middle pinnacle of `w`) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier’s designs and reworks them for contemporary use.\n\nThis package installs the `.ttf` files in the variable variant.",

This can be useful for:\n* exporting data (e.g. getting a list of all users and using Excel to filter on certain fields)\n* providing populations and/or evidence during audits (e.g. Due Diligence, Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX))\n* cleanup actions (e.g. old or unused user accounts)\n* inventory checks (e.g. find out which computers no longer log on)\n* implementing procedures to improve compliancy (e.g. General Computer Controls (GCC), Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX))\n* determining if home folders on a file server no longer belong to an active user\n* getting information before problems occur (e.g. determine which user accounts are about to expire)\n\n## Examples\n* List all users on the console using the specified server, port and credentials:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f TXT -h SERVER:389 -u MYLOGIN -p MYPASS\n  ```\n* Create Excel 2007 or higher .xlsx file with report containing all users:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f XLSX -o All.xlsx\n  ```\n- Create Excel 2007 or higher .xlsx file with report containing all users created in the last 31 days:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f XLSX -o CreatedLastMonth.xlsx -c 31\n  ```\n- Create Excel 2007 or higher .xlsx file with report containing all disabled users not logged in in the last 180 days:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f XLSX -o Obsolete.xlsx -d -l -180\n  ```\n- Create Excel 2007 or higher .xlsx file with report containing all enabled users that expire in the next 32 days:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f XLSX -o ExpiringNextMonth.xlsx -x 32 -e\n  ```\n- Create HTML file with report containing all users belong to any of the given groups:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f HTML -o Admins.html -e -g \"CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=DOMAIN,DC=LOCAL\" -g \"CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=DOMAIN,DC=LOCAL\" -g \"CN=Enterprise Admins,CN=Users,DC=DOMAIN,DC=LOCAL\" -g \"CN=Schema Admins,CN=Users,DC=DOMAIN,DC=LOCAL\"\n  ```\n- Create HTML file with report containing all enabled users that have not logged in during the past 45 days:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f HTML -o NotRecentlyLoggedIn.html -l -45 -e\n  ```\n- Create XML file with report containing all users in the specified OU:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f XML -o DeleteMe.xml -b \"OU=DeleteMe,OU=Company,DC=DOMAIN,DC=LOCAL\"\n  ```\n- Create TSV (Tab Separated Values) file with report containing enabled all users that have \"password never expires\" enabled using a custom LDAP query:\n  ```\n  ADReportUsers -f TSV -o AccountNeverExpires.txt -e -q \"(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=65536))\"\n  ```",

You can also save the desired settings into a configuration file and then run the program automatically from command-line with the desired settings.\n\n### Examples of what you can do with AdvancedRun\n\n* Run the RegEdit of Windows as normal user on Windows 10/8/7/Vista, without elevation. In this mode, you'll not be able to access or modify Registry keys that require admin rights.\n* Run the RegEdit of Windows as SYSTEM user on Windows 10/8/7/Vista. In this mode, you'll be able to access the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SECURITY key.\n* Run a program with a user of another running process.\n* Run a program in high priority.\n* Run a specific instance of program in Windows XP compatibility mode, without making global changes in the Registry.\n* Run a specific instance of program with different PATH environment string, but without modifying the PATH string of the entire system and without using batch files or command prompt window.\n* Run a program with a full set of environment variables you choose, ignoring the system environment variables completely.\n\n### System Requirements\n\nThis utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported. Some of the features, like 'Run As SYSTEM User' and 'Run As user of selected process' are not supported on Windows XP.\n\n**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/advancedrun/readme.md)**\n\t\n\n---\n\n**Click here to [Patreon-ize](https://www.patreon.com/bcurran3) the package maintainer.**\n\n---",

Using the GPU for\nrendering enables optimizations that simply aren't possible in other emulators.\nAlacritty currently supports macOS and Linux, and Windows.\n\n## About\n\nAlacritty is focused on simplicity and performance. The performance goal means\nit should be faster than any other terminal emulator available. The simplicity\ngoal means that it doesn't have features such as tabs or splits (which can be\nbetter provided by a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor\nniceties like a GUI config editor.\n\nThe software is considered to be at an **alpha** level of readiness--there are\nmissing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as a daily\ndriver.\n\nPrecompiled binaries are available for Windows through [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jwilm/alacritty).\nPrecompiled binaries for other platforms are minimally blocked on a stable config format. For now, Alacritty must be\nbuilt from source.\n\n## Further information\n\n- [Announcing Alacritty, a GPU-Accelerated Terminal Emulator](http://jwilm.io/blog/announcing-alacritty/) January 6, 2017\n- [A short talk about Alacritty at the Rust Meetup January 2017](https://air.mozilla.org/rust-meetup-january-2017/) (starts at 57:00)\n- [Alacritty Lands Scrollback, Publishes Benchmarks](https://jwilm.io/blog/alacritty-lands-scrollback/) September 17, 2018\n\n## Installation\n\nSome operating systems already provide binaries for Alacritty, for everyone else the instructions\nto build Alacritty from source, can be found [here](INSTALL.md).\n\n### Windows\n\nPrebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the artifacts section of [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jwilm/alacritty).\n\n## Configuration\n\nAlthough it's possible the default configuration would work on your system,\nyou'll probably end up wanting to customize it anyhow. There is a default\n`alacritty.yml`, `alacritty_macos.yml`, and `alacritty_windows.yml` at the git repository root.\nAlacritty looks for the configuration file as the following paths:\n\n`%UserProfile%\\alacritty.yml`\n\nMany configuration options will take effect immediately upon saving changes to\nthe config file. The only exception is the `font` and `dimensions` sections\nwhich requires Alacritty to be restarted. For further explanation of the config\nfile, please consult the comments in the default config file.\n\n## Issues (known, unknown, feature requests, etc)\n\nIf you run into a problem with Alacritty, please file an issue. If you've got a\nfeature request, feel free to ask about it. Keep in mind that Alacritty is very\nmuch not looking to be a feature-rich terminal emulator with all sorts of bells\nand widgets. It's primarily a cross-platform, blazing fast `tmux` renderer that\nJust Works.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**\n\nIn the terminals I've benchmarked against, alacritty is either faster, WAY\nfaster, or at least neutral. There are no benchmarks in which I've found\nAlacritty to be slower.\n\n**_My arrow keys don't work._**\n\nIt sounds like you deleted some key bindings from your config file. Please\nreference the default config file to restore them.\n\n## IRC\n\nAlacritty discussion can be found in `#alacritty` on freenode.\n\n## License\n\nAlacritty is released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0].\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0]: https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE\n[faq]: https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty#faq\n[tmux]: https://github.com/tmux/tmux",

Alacritty uses\n[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator\nthroughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using\nit. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a\nbug.\n\nOther aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult\nto quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save\nresources, which might be preferred by some users.\n\nIf you have doubts about Alacritty's performance or usability, the best way to\nquantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific\nusecases.\n\n**_Why isn't feature X implemented?_**\n\nAlacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other\nterminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it's just not a\ngood fit for Alacritty. This means you won't find things like tabs or splits\n(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor\nniceties like a GUI config editor.\n\n[tmux]: https://github.com/tmux/tmux\n\n## License\n\nAlacritty is released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0].\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0]: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/tree/v0.16.0-rc1/LICENSE-APACHE",

All done through Windows Explorer.\n\n\nHow TO INSTALL:\n\nExtract all files from the zip folder. Make sure to save them in a folder that wont be moved or deleted. (Chocolatey will do this for you.)\n\nOnce extracted run the Right_Click_Options.exe in the extracted folder and then in that program click on \"Add Right Click Menu\".\n\nThat's it! That will add the right click menu options to all .exe and .com files. Nothing is installed or written anywhere else.\n\nTo uninstall just run Right_Click_Options.exe again and click \"Remove Right Click Menu\" and then simply delete all the files in the program folder.\n\nIf for any reason you move the files to a new folder you need to run the \"Add Right Click Menu\" option again so the registry keys will be updated with the new file paths.",

    "description": "Let's say you must test something that involves a lot of different variables. Configuration testing is like that: different printers, different print options, different documents. Who knows what combination will fail? But you can't try all combinations of all variables together, because that would be too many tests. So instead, you could create tests that pair each value of each of the variables with each value of each other variable at least once. Allpairs is a tool I wrote that will find a reasonably small set of test cases to satisfy that coverage standard. For instance, to try all combinations of 10 variables with ten values each would require 10,000,000,000 test cases. Allpairs only requires 177 cases.",

Buy it for only US$ 15 (PRO - Lollipop/Jellybean)\n\n##Introducing AMIDuOS\nAMIDuOS is a revolutionary new concept that brings the functionality, depth and fun of the Android experience to Microsoft® Windows devices. It runs on nearly any Windows 7,8 or 10 PC or tablet device for fast, easy switching between Windows and Android environments - without the need to dual boot!\n\n##Features\n###Full Android Experience\nAMIDuOS is nothing less than the full Android experience, with all the features that the latest version of the popular mobile operating system has to offer. It runs fast, looks crisp and sharp and performs with no limitations – because it is 100% native Android running on your Windows hardware!\n\n###Application Compatibility\nAMIDuOS can run nearly all of the Android applications available in Android app markets. To get you started, it comes with preloaded Amazon Appstore. To make AMIDuOS your own, simply add your favorite Android app markets with the AMIDuOS package installer. AMIDuOS is also ARM v7 compatible, so it can run most popular ARM applications as well.\n\n###Performance\nAMIDuOS supports 3D acceleration, so you can enjoy a superior Android gaming experience in Windows. It uses Windows OpenGL drivers for improved frame rates to support even the most graphics-intensive games. Applications run mainly in the native x86-mode to provide peak performance, while ARM emulation is only performed on as-needed basis. This helps AMIDuOS to save power and extend battery life to the fullest.\n\n###Device Support\nWhile AMIDuOS leverages device drivers from Windows™ to enable near-native performance in Android, it also supports key peripherals and sensors of the Windows hardware, including high-definition cameras, audio and microphone. Sensor support includes Ambient Light, Accelerometer, Gyrometer, Compass and Orientation - giving you the full Android tablet/mobile experience.\n\n###Tablet Features\nAMIDuOS provides a complete Android tablet experience with multitouch and gesture support like Pinch and Zoom, along with a full-featured software keyboard. It also supports Compass and GPS functionality, allowing map navigation by multitouch.\n\n###Desktop Features\nIn Desktop mode AMIDuOS offers full hardware keyboard support, including keyboard shortcuts. The screen orientation can be changed to portrait mode for applications that require it. AMIDuOS also supports Ethernet and simulated WiFi to provide network access for Android applications.\n\n###Storage and File Sharing\nFile sharing between Windows and Android is also supported in AMIDuOS, so you can share pictures, videos and music between both OS modes with ease. AMIDuOS also supports SD card emulation and allows you to configure the SD card size with an easy-to-use configuration tool.",

Although, if The Medic dies, the shield will break.  \nThe only exception is The Officer; they will still die if they try to kill a Crewmate.  \nThe Medic's other feature shows when they find a corpse: they can get a report that contains clues to the killer's identity.  \nThe type of information they get is based on a timer that can be configured inside the host's config file. \n  \n## Officer\nThe Officer is a class of Crewmate that is allowed to kill people, similar to Impostors.  \nTheir goal is to locate the Impostor and deliver vigilante justice, but if they accidentally shoot a Crewmate, they die instead.  \n  \n## Engineer\nThe Engineer can repair one emergency per game from anywhere on the entire map.  \nThe other ablity of The Engineer is that they are able to use the vents that were previously exclusive to Impostors.  \n\n## Joker\nThe Joker is interesting; they aren't part of the Crewmates **or** Impostors, and they can only win by being falsely convicted as an Impostor.  \nIf The Joker get's voted off the ship, the game will end instantly.  \nThe Joker also has no tasks.  \n\n*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.

The NDK may not be appropriate for most novice Android programmers who need to use only Java code and framework APIs to develop their apps. However, the NDK can be useful for cases in which you need to do one or more of the following:\n\n* Squeeze extra performance out of a device to achieve low latency or run computationally intensive applications, such as games or physics simulations.\n* Reuse your own or other developers' C or C++ libraries.\n\n**Please Note:** Due to the way Google versions their android-ndk package, it is not compatible with the NuGet spec.

    "description": "AquaSnap greatly enhances the way you can arrange windows on your Desktop. It gives you the possibility to snap windows to the edges or to the corners of the desktop, set windows to remain on top, stretch windows and more. It is freeware for personal single-monitor use only.\n\nThis software requires a license for all options to be available, but there is a 60 minutes trial for it and there are free options as well.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Window docking: Drag and Drop your windows to the sides or corners of the screen and they are automatically resized to fit one half or one quarter of the screen. Just like the built-in Aero Snap function of Windows 7 but with more possibilities! This is especially useful on a 4K monitor or on multiple monitors.\n- Window tiling: When two windows are side by side, resizing one of them while pressing [Ctrl] will also resize the other one. It's an easy and powerful way to modify the layout of several tiled windows.\n- Window snapping: AquaSnap allows you to easily align your windows by making them behave like magnets. This simple feature is the cornerstone of AquaSnap and has been carefully designed to assist you without getting in your way.\n- Window stretching: This is another powerful way to quickly split your desktop space between several windows. Double-click on the edge of a window to maximize it in one direction. Do the same while pressing [Shift] to maximize it vertically or horizontally.\n- Move windows together: Professional applications with complex UI often scatter small toolbox windows on your desktop. Keep them grouped and move them all at once. Move one window while pressing [Ctrl] and the whole group of adjacent windows will follow.\n- Make it stay on top: This is the best way to have this window always visible while working on a fullscreen application. Shake a window to make it transparent and always on top. Shake it again to restore it's normal state.\n\n**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.",

    "description": ".NET Core is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub. It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.\n\nThe runtime package store enables creating a precompiled cache of common libraries which can be centrally provisioned and not deployed to every application reducing deployment size and time.\n\n.NET Core supports Windows 7 SP1 / Server 2008 R2 or later. On Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2, [security update KB2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2533623) must be installed, according to [documented system requirements](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md).\n\nThe package supports the following parameters (--package-parameters, --params):\n\n- `Quiet` - suppress display of native installer progress window (may be needed on Server Core)\n- `Skip32Bit` - do not install the 32-bit package store on a 64-bit system\n\nExample: cinst -y --params=\"Quiet Skip32Bit\" aspnetcore-runtimepackagestore",

    "description": "Artistic Style is a source code indenter, formatter, and beautifier for the C, C++, C++/CLI, Objective-C, C# and Java programming languages.\n\nWhen indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to use both spaces and tab characters to create the wanted indentation. Moreover, some editors by default insert spaces instead of tabs when pressing the tab key, and other editors (Emacs for example) have the ability to \"pretty up\" lines by automatically setting up the white space before the code on the line, possibly inserting spaces in a code that up to now used only tabs for indentation.\n\nSince the NUMBER of space characters showed on screen for each tab character in the source code changes between editors (unless the user sets up the number to his liking...), one of the standard problems programmers are facing when moving from one editor to another is that code containing both spaces and tabs that was up to now perfectly indented, suddenly becomes a mess to look at when changing to another editor. Even if you as a programmer take care to ONLY use spaces or tabs, looking at other people's source code can still be problematic.\n\nTo address this problem, Artistic Style was created - a filter written in C++ that automatically re-indents and re-formats C / C++ / Objective-C / C++/CLI / C# / Java source files. It can be used from a command line, or it can be incorporated as classes in another C++ program.\n\n## Features\n\n- It's free and open source!\n- Cross-platform application works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and others.\n- Supports 15 popular bracket styles.\n- Over 90 formatting options.\n- Detailed documentation for use and options\n- Available in over 20 languages with easy additions\n- Supports UTF8, UTF16, and most other character encodings.\n- Can process entire projects recursively.\n- Will not update unchanged files.\n- Checksum prevents dropped or duplicated data.\n- Seamless integration with many development environments and editors.\n- Can be included in C/C++ and Objective-C projects as a shared (DLL) or static library.\n- Can be included in Java projects as a Java Native Interface (KNI)\n- Can be included in C#, Python, Pascal, and other projects as a shared library (DLL).\n\n## Package Parameters\n\n- `/KeepAllFiles` - Don't remove any of the source/build files and other unneeded files.\n\n**Example**\n`choco install astyle --params '\"/KeepAllFiles\"'",

    "description": "Asymptote is a powerful, descriptive, vector-graphics language with a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing, inspired by [MetaPost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaPost) but with an improved C++-like syntax. Asymptote provides the same high-quality typesetting for figures that LaTeX does for scientific and mathematics text.\n    \nA major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.\n\nYou can even run it in your browser without installing it, using the [Asymptote Web Application](https://tinyurl.com/asyweb). Just enter the code: **import workcone;** (including the semicolon) and click the `Run` button.\n\n![Venn diagram example](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/asymptote/screenshots/14498.jpg/max/max/1)\n\n### Features of Asymptote:\n* provides a portable standard for typesetting mathematical figures, just as TeX/LaTeX has become the standard for typesetting equations;\n* generates high-quality PostScript, PDF, SVG, WebGL, and PRC vector graphics;\n* embeds 3D vector WebGL graphics within HTML files;\n* embeds 3D vector PRC graphics within PDF files;\n* inspired by MetaPost, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like programming syntax and IEEE floating-point numerics;\n* runs on all major platforms (UNIX, MacOS, Microsoft Windows);\n* mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex multiplication);\n* LaTeX typesetting of labels (for document consistency);\n* uses the simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads) and objects that should scale with figure size;\n* fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three dimensions;\n* compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without sacrificing portability;\n* high-level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote language itself, allowing them to be tailored to specific applications. \n\n### Recommended additional packages\n* [MiKTeX](https://chocolatey.org/packages/miktex.install) or another TEX implementation (i.e. [TeX Live](https://chocolatey.org/packages/texlive)) will be required to typeset labels.\n* [Ghostscript](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ghostscript.app)\n* [ImageMagick](https://chocolatey.org/packages/imagemagick.app) is required to support output formats other than HTML, PDF, SVG, and PNG.\n* [Python3](https://chocolatey.org/packages/python3) or [Anaconda3](https://chocolatey.org/packages/anaconda3) is only needed if you wish to try out the graphical user interface ([see Chapter 11](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/doc/GUI.html#GUI) of the documentation.)\n\n## 64-bit only\n* As of version 2.93, Asymptote for Windows is 64-bit only.",

    "description": "## AtomicParsley (Portable)\n\n### AtomicParsley is a lightweight command line program for reading, parsing and setting metadata into MPEG-4 files supporting these styles of metadata:\n\n* iTunes-style metadata into .mp4, .m4a, .m4p, .m4v, .m4b files\n* 3gp-style assets (3GPP TS 26.444 version 6.4.0 Release 6 specification conforming) in 3GPP, 3GPP2, MobileMP4 and derivatives\n* ISO copyright notices at movie and track level for MPEG-4 and derivative files\n* uuid private user extension text and file embedding for MPEG-4 and derivative files\n\nThe MPEG-4 container is based on Apple's Quicktime .mov container (just more sane) and there are a number of similarites - as well as differences. Each MPEG-4 file lists a \"major file brand\" that broadly says which specification the file adheres to. For example, an iTunes audio file typically lists 'M4A ' as its major file brand, while a 3GPP2 .3g2 file has something like '3g2a'. It is based on this major file brand that AtomicParsley allows a style of metadata to be set. Since there is nothing in the 3GPP2 specification regarding iTunes-style metadata, its use is prevented on such files. Similarly, a 3gp 'location' asset is not available for an iTMS video file. The first paragraph here sums the situation up well.\n\nWith the exception of artwork, all iTunes-style tags support only 1 piece of metadata - you can't have for example 3 title tags. 3gp assets and copyright notices support multiple tags, but they must differ in the language setting for that tag. You can have for example 3 title tags, but 1 in english, 1 in spanish, 1 in undefined. All iTunes-style text metadata is always in UTF-8; 3gp assets and copyright notices can be in set in UTF-8 or UTF-16. All strings are converted internally to UTF-8, converting as necessary. On *nix platforms, input is in UTF-8; the native Windows port supports full UTF-16 input.\n\n#### [choco://atomicparsley](choco://atomicparsley)\nTo use choco:// protocol URLs, install [(unofficial) choco:// Protocol support ](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-protocol-support)\n\n### Package-specific issue\nIf this package isn't up-to-date for some days, [Create an issue](https://github.com/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages/issues/new/choose)\n\nSupport the package maintainer and [![Patreon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tunisiano187/Chocolatey-packages@d15c4e19c709e7148588d4523ffc6dd3cd3c7e5e/icons/patreon.png)](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=39585820)",

It help’s you protect your account from hackers and hijackers by adding an additional layer of security.\n\nWhy Authy is the best multi factor authentication app:\n\n**- Secure Cloud Backups:**\nDid you lose your device and got locked out of all of your accounts? Authy provides secure cloud encrypted backups so you will never lose access to your tokens again. We use the same algorithm banks and the NSA use to protect their information.\n\n**- Multi Device Synchronization:**\nAre your re-scanning all your QR codes just to add them to your tablet and smartphone? With authy you can simply add devices to your account and all of your 2fa tokens will automatically synchronize.\n\n**- Offline:**\nStill waiting for an SMS to arrive? do you travel constantly and lose access to your accounts? Authy generates secure tokens offline from the safety of your Android device, this way you can authenticate securely even when in airplane mode.\n\n**- All of your accounts:**\nWe support most major multifactor authentication accounts including Facebook, Dropbox, Amazon, Gmail, and thousands of other providers. We also support 8 digit tokens.\n\n**- Protect your bitcoins:**\nAuthy is the preferred two factor authentication solution to protect your bitcoin wallet. We are the default 2fa provider for trusted companies like Coinbase, CEX.IO, BitGo and many others.\n\n**- What is two factor authentication?**\n\"Two-factor authentication is one of the best things you can do to make sure your accounts don't get hacked\" - LifeHacker\nhttps://www.authy.com/learn-more\n\n## NOTES\n\n- As of version 1.6.0, the 32bit architecture have been dropped as conversion with the authy support team have said it won't be updated in the future.\n  If you still need to install the 32bit architecture, please install version 1.5.0 and pin the package.",
