- [ ] Create reputation system (contributor badges)
- [ ] Send notifications when solutions are approved
- [ ] Build solution diffing (detect duplicates)

**Deliverables:**
- Users can submit solutions
- Admin can approve/reject submissions
- Spam filtered automatically

**Success Metrics:**
- 5+ user-submitted solutions per week
- 80%+ approval rate (low spam)
- Average 24-hour moderation time

---

### Week 6: Gamification & Engagement

**Goal:** Encourage community participation

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add contributor leaderboard
- [ ] Implement achievement badges
